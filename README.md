# 👋 Hi, I'm Hamza Raza

I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** with a knack for building clean, scalable, and performance-driven applications. Whether it's rewriting a frontend from scratch or crafting a real-time backend on AWS, I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant code.

## 🚀 What I'm About

- 🔭 Currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Computer Science** at **Saarland University**, diving deeper into distributed systems, full-stack architectures, and system design.
- ⚡ Previously built and shipped production-ready apps using **Next.js**, **NestJS**, **TypeScript**, **AWS**, **Redis**, and **WebSockets**.
- 🧪 Converted frontend-heavy logic into lean **serverless backends**, reducing app bloat and boosting performance.
- 🔁 Led the full migration of a large-scale app from **Next.js 12 → 14**, building the design system and writing robust unit/integration tests along the way.
- 🤖 Worked on a research-based tool that translates English into **Pakistani Sign Language** using **Python**, **NLTK**, and **OpenCV**—published and presented at a national conference.
- 🧠 Developed a web interface for a **Q-learning TurtleBot3 simulator** in ROS, using **Flask** to bridge frontend and simulation APIs.

## 💡 Currently Exploring

- Optimizing CI/CD pipelines for full-stack applications  
- Better ways to make frontend code more maintainable and testable  
- Contributing to **CRM**, **AI-powered tools**, and **open-source projects** that matter
